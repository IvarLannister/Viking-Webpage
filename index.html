                <p>Vikings[a] is the modern name given to seafaring Norse pirates from southern Scandinavia (present-day Denmark, Norway and Sweden)[3][4][5] who from the late 8th to the late 11th centuries raided, pirated, traded and settled throughout parts of Europe.[6][7][8] They also voyaged as far as the Mediterranean, North Africa, the Middle East, and North America. In some of the countries they raided and settled in, this period is popularly known as the Viking Age, and the term "Viking" also commonly includes the inhabitants of the Norse homelands as a collective whole. The Vikings had a profound impact on the Early medieval history of Scandinavia, the British Isles, France, Estonia, and Kievan Rus'.[9
                Expert sailors and navigators aboard their characteristic longships, Vikings established Norse settlements and governments in the British Isles, Ireland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland, Normandy, the Baltic coast, and along the Dnieper and Volga trade routes in what is now European Russia, Belarus[10] and Ukraine[11] (where they were also known as Varangians). The Normans, Norse-Gaels, Rus' people, Faroese and Icelanders emerged from these Norse colonies. The Vikings also voyaged to Constantinople, Iran,[12] and Arabia.[13] They were the first Europeans to reach North America, briefly settling in Newfoundland (Vinland). While spreading Norse culture to foreign lands, they simultaneously brought home slaves, concubines and foreign cultural influences to Scandinavia, profoundly influencing the genetic[14] and historical development of both. During the Viking Age the Norse homelands were gradually consolidated from smaller kingdoms into three larger kingdoms: Denmark, Norway and Sweden.[15]</p>

                <p>Ragnar "Lothbrok" Sigurdsson (Old Norse: Ragnarr Loðbrók, Ragnar means "keeper of the fort" and Lothbrok means "shaggy breeches") is a Viking farmer and warrior who yearns to raid the rumored riches of undiscovered England. His first wife is Lagertha, and they have two children named Gyda and Bjorn. His second wife is Aslaug, and they have four sons named Ubbe, Hvitserk, Sigurd, and Ivar. Ragnar is the younger brother of Rollo. He becomes King of Kattegat.</p>

                <h2 id="ambition">Ragnars Ambition</h2>
                <p>Ragnar is in the Eastern Balts alongside his brother Rollo, fighting several Baltic tribesmen. After they dispatch the eastlanders, Ragnar sees a vision of Odin, in the guise of the Wanderer, directing the Valkyries in taking up the spirits of fallen Northmen to Valhalla. Sometime thereafter, Ragnar returns to the small farming and fishing hamlet where he and his family reside, not far from the village of Kattegat with what little plunder he can take from the Baltic.

                    Frustrated by the restrictive policies of his local chieftain, the short-sighted Earl Haraldson, Ragnar has evidently put much thought into his plans of sailing across the ocean to plunder the west, where he believes great riches lie in wait.
                    
                    Ragnar then prepares his son, Bjorn, for his rite of manhood, where he shall receive his first arm-ring from the earl. On the way, Ragnar tells his son that he is dissatisfied with the current policies of the earl and how he longs to travel to the Western lands and see what great riches might be there. He also prepares Bjorn for the possible consequences that might come about by his challenging of the earl, telling him that he will soon make a decision that will change everything.
                    
                    The next day, Ragnar and Bjorn arrive in Kattegat, where Rollo awaits them. Ragnar tells his brother of his plans to travel west, and also of how he was visited by a wanderer who gave him special devices by which he can navigate the open sea, a sunboard and a sunstone.
                </p>

                <h2 id="ascension">Ragnars Ascension</h2>
                <p>Ragnar tells Björn that he never wanted to be king, but only to explore and farm. Ragnar decides to sail back to Wessex to claim land for farming as outlined in their treaty. When Ragnar and his warriors arrive in Wessex, King Ecbert informs Ragnar that to receive their land, the Vikings must fight for Princess Kwenthrith to appease King Ecbert's nobles. Ragnar and his vassals then decide to fight for the restoration of the throne for Mercia for Princess Kwenthrith. In the meantime, Lagertha stays behind in Wessex with Athelstan and King Ecbert to start constructing their settlement. Ragnar wins a battle against the Mercians but Torstein's arm is injured. A celebration is held in honor of the victory. Torstein's left arm becomes gangrenous and he asks Floki to amputate. Kwenthrith asks for the head of her uncle. When Ragnar questions her hatred, she admits to having been sexually abused as a child by him and her oldest brother. Ragnar and his warriors begin climbing the mountain to fight Kwenthrith's brother and his army. Kwenthrith asks Ragnar to spare her brother. Torstein volunteers to go first to make sure the army is there and dies valiantly. In the battle, Þórunn is severely injured. Aethelwulf ambushes the Mercians and Prince Burgred surrenders. Ragnar and his warriors return to Kattegat, and they learn of Siggy's death. Ragnar is suspicious about why Aslaug was not watching the children. A messenger arrives to tell Lagertha that her earldom has been usurped by Kalf and she asks Ragnar to help her win it back. Ragnar tells the men that they will raid Paris in the spring. Ragnar returns with Lagertha to speak with Kalf, although he decides not to help fight for Lagertha. Floki tells Ragnar that Aslaug slept with Harbard and that Harbard is another name for Odin. Ragnar does not believe that. Rollo reveals that Athelstan no longer wears his arm-ring. Floki receives a sign that "blood must be spilled," and kills Athelstan while he is praying. Ragnar carries Athelstan's body up to the side of the mountain for burial, devastated. Ragnar's Viking fleet, also reinforced by Earl Siegfried arrives in Francia. Ragnar shocks the Viking army when he decides to leave Floki in charge of the attack. The Vikings attack Paris. Lagertha, Kalf, and Erlendur lead an attack on the city gate. Meanwhile, Floki, Ragnar, Bjorn, and Rollo try to breach the walls from boats on the river. Princess Gisla manages to restore faith in the Frank troops by revealing the Oriflamme. Eventually, the defense holds, repelling the Vikings. Ragnar manages to see the city of Paris for a moment but is thrown from the walls he then finds Bjorn badly wounded. At the camp the warriors have to deal with their wounded. With the Vikings still recovering, Ragnar orders another attack. Led by Rollo, Lagertha, and Kalf they manage to pass the bridge, but they are once again pushed back. Siegfried is captured and executed.  Ragnar's wounds won't heal, leaving him weak. Trying to restore his leadership, he secretly meets the Franks. Although offered gold and silver, Ragnar doesn't accept. Knowing his end is drawing near, he asks to be baptized and to be buried inside the city. The Franks pay gold and silver to the Vikings, but they show no sign of leaving. Many people are still shocked at Ragnar's Christening, and when the badly wounded leader dies, Bjorn is in charge. The warriors place Ragnar into a wooden coffin and escort it to the gates of Paris, where they meet the Bishop. The coffin is brought inside the Cathedral to be blessed, but Ragnar suddenly jumps out of the coffin alive. He takes Princess Gisla as a hostage and forces the guards to open the gates, allowing the Vikings to enter the city. Most of the Vikings then set sail for home, but a small party, led by Rollo, remain. While sailing home Ragnar tells Floki that he knows he is Athelstan's killer.</p>

                <h2 id="transition">Ragnars Transition</h2>
                <p>Ragnar gives Alfred Athelstan's cross and Ragnar is put into a carriage to be taken to Ælle. The man driving the carriage is blind. The driver tells Ragnar, "I can see you, Ragnar Lothbrok. I can see you." This fulfills the Seer's prophecy that there would come a day when the blind man would see him. Ragnar struggles with many visions on his journey to death. King Ælle beats and tortures Ragnar and cuts a cross into his head, but Ragnar will not repent. The reason King Ælle cuts a bloody cross into Ragnar's forehead as part of his torture is because Ragnar painted a bloody cross on Ælle's brother, Æthelwulf of Northumbria's, forehead prior to killing him in A King's Ransom. He remembers Athelstan teaching him to pray. Ragnar does not utter a word when being tortured. When it is finally time for him to die, he roars a poem at the top of his lungs about Odin and Valhalla. He says he is not afraid and he welcomes the Valkyries. He is then thrown into a pit of venomous snakes.<br></p>

                <h4>Ragnars Final Words</h4>
                <strong>It gladdens me to know that Odin prepares for a feast! Soon I shall be drinking ale from curved horns. This hero that comes into Valhalla does not lament his death. I shall not enter Odin’s hall with fear. There, I shall wait for my sons to join me. And when they do, I will bask in their tales of triumph. The Aesir will welcome me. My death comes without apology. And I welcome the Valkyries to summon me home!</strong>

                <p>Ivar Ragnarsson, also known as Ivar "the Boneless" by his father due to his disease, is the youngest son of Ragnar Lothbrok and Aslaug and the King of Kattegat after his father.Contents</p>

                <h2 id="#Ivar-ambition">Ivar's Ambition</h2>
                <p>Ivar is a sadist, sarcastic, angry, bloodthirsty, and violent person. Even as a child he is cruel and dangerous. When he learns of Siggy’s death he laughs. He literally murders another child with an axe over a disagreement during a ballgame and isn’t any less unhinged when he grows up. He is easily angered, arrogant, and selfish as a child, though this is partly due to Aslaug’s bad parenting. He is indifferent upon hearing of the murder of the entire Wessex settlement. His ruthless attitude makes him feared by everyone, with the possible exceptions of Bjorn, Ragnar, and Aslaug. His bloodthirsty antics often teach people not to underestimate him just because he is labeled a cripple. If you think he is inferior in any way, shape, or form to his brothers, he will show you otherwise. He is the best archer and axe thrower of Ragnar’s sons, and is a match for at least Hvitserk and Sigurd with a sword, despite being unable to walk. His sheer rage and spite are enough to make him dangerous and feared. He has the most upper-body strength of his brothers due to having to drag himself by his arms to get anywhere for most of his life.</p>

                <h2 id="Ivar-ascension">Ivar's Ascension</h2>
                <p>A few months afterward, Sigurd's funeral is held Bjorn and Halfdan leave the Great Heathen Army to sail back to the Mediterranean Sea and King Harald leaves the army as well to sail to Kattegat. Ivar, Hvitserk, and Ubbe rule jointly over their newly acquired land in East Anglia. Floki decides to leave the great heathen army to sail to the unknown, Ivar and Floki said there goodbyes. Ivar and Ubbe have an argument to either continue raiding or make peace with the English kingdoms but Ivar persuades his brothers to go north and conquer the city of York and turn it into their stronghold. Ivar, Hvitserk, and Ubbe decide to attack the town on Ascension Day, quickly overrunning the meager garrison before butchering the inhabitants, during the battle Ivar shows his brutality by torturing and killing the bishop. Ivar recruits bodyguards and decides to have a tattoo of a giant snake on his back. Ubbe and Hvitsek questioned Ivar as to why does he need a bodyguard and Ivar explains the reason is that he is a cripple. Ivar shows his brothers that he can now stand and walk on his own feet with the help of new leg braces and a crutch.The Saxons led by King Aethelwulf and Bishop Heahmund entered the town through a section of the old Roman walls that were purposefully neglected by Ivar to lure the Saxons in the town. Once the army formed up, the Saxon forces were split into two. Aethelwulf and Heahmund, Ivar ordered the Danes to fire their arrows, taking out some Saxons. the Saxons were then trapped as the Norsemen raised wooden barricades to contain them while the archers continued depleting their ranks. The Saxons were then lured into small streets and alleyways that were laden with low standing spikes upon which dozens of men fell, fatally wounding themselves. The Danes finally emerged from cover before engaging Aethelwulf's forces into vicious, close-quarter street fighting. Heahmund's force was likewise trapped in a street where the Danes poured oil on the floor before lightning it, which burnt and killed several Saxons. Hundreds of Saxon forces then emerged to confront Ivar, who, in a ferocious stance, provoked the frightened Saxon warriors, claiming they couldn't kill him. While the fight also raged throughout the town, Ubbe's men then came out to meet the Saxons led by Heahmund's.After the battle, the Saxons suffered a crushing defeat. Ubbe and Hvitserk propose a peace, but Ivar wants to continue the war. The two brothers secretly leave at night to negotiate with the Saxons, Aethelwulf seemingly accepts their offer, but Heahmund arranges to have the brothers humiliated. With Ubbe having lost face, Ivar secures his position as the leader of the Great Army. Ubbe and Hvitserk prepare to leave for Kattegat with their few followers, however, at the last minute, Hvitserk defected to join Ivar. The Saxons laid siege to York, they massacred their hunting parties and blocked the city while pretending to burn bodies. Ivar and Hvitserk are in the sewers of the city and Ivar informs Hvitserk that he has a plan. The city is deserted the Saxons celebrate but they are cut short when Vikings appear from the sewers and engage in battle. The Vikings win and the Saxons retreat. During the battle, Bishop Heahmund is captured and spared by Ivar. Ivar has a conversation with Heahmund about religion and Ivar decides to take the Bishop with him to meet King Harald.</p>

                <h2 id="Ivar-transition">Ivar's Transition</h2>
                <p>Ivar loses the Siege of Kattegat due to being betrayed by Kattegat's people and his wife, whom he kills, during a short assault on the city. After this, he escapes and goes into self-exile. His current whereabouts are unknown, though he is presumably headed to Novgorod.<br></p>
                
                <h4>Ivar's Quotes</h4>
                <strong>I Have No Interest in Piece.<br>If you are fated, it doesn't matter if you choose or not. You simply have the illusion of being free to choose.</strong>

                <h2 id="Bjorn-ambition">Bjorn's Ambition</h2>
                <p>Upon turning 12 and coming of age in Viking society, Björn received his arm ring from the then reigning Earl Haraldson. Björn had yearned to be a warrior like his father, desperate for recognition as a man and to fight in the raids with his father, but his youth and inexperience hold him back. Björn is a loyal and dutiful son to both parents and showed no fear when he broke up a physical fight between his parents in Wrath of the Northmen.Though obedient to his parents, Björn resented being put under the supervision of the young Northumbrian monk Athelstan who was captured as a slave from Lindisfarne.     Brought along by Ragnar on his trip to Gotaland for King Horik, Björn was witness to the beginning of his father's relationship with Aslaug. Disgusted, Björn confronted his father about his infidelity, making him swear that it will never happen again. While Ragnar did promise this and tried to keep it, Aslaug had already become pregnant with a son.</p>


                <h2 id="Bjorn-ascension">Bjorn's Ascension</h2>
                <p>When Kalf and Erlendur learn that Björn is isolated in the mountains, they dispatch a Berserker to assassinate him. Although superficially wounded in the encounter, Björn outwits and subdues his opponent by whipping a handful of fishing leaders bearing heavy fish hooks into his face. He tortures his captive, asking who sent him, but the man refuses to talk, so Björn disembowels him. Björn then goes to visit his mother in Hedeby. Kalf and Erlendur are visibly disappointed that their assassin failed. Björn claims he came to take Torvi away with him, and does so, though Erlendur forces her to leave her son behind. When Björn returns to Kattegat, he is suspicious of the newcomer King Harald.Conversing with his father as they prepare for the second raid on Paris, Björn is rebuked for ignoring his daughter and for separating Torvi from her child. Björn retorts that Ragnar tried to separate him from his mother as a child, but Ragnar replies that Lagertha left him and Björn chose to go with her, though he acknowledges that he had been a bad husband and that Björn should not repeat his mistakes. When Björn is looking over his map of Europe later, Torvi comes to visit him and notices a ring that he had taken from the Berserker. As they start to make love, Torvi remarks that the ring was passed to Erlendur from his father King Horik, revealing to Björn that Erlendur ordered the assassination attempt.Later, as the Vikings are settling into France in order to come up with a plan for their battle strategy, Björn approaches Erlendur asking about the ring and whether he knows about it. Erlendur replies that he knows nothing of the ring which is relayed in turn to Torvi who says he is lying for she knows it is his father King Horik's ring. When the Vikings travel upriver towards Paris, led by Rollo, the ships are shot at from the forts by Frankish soldiers. When the Franks lower the chain between the two forts, several ships are capsized and sunk. Björn helps many warriors out of the water, including Harald. When returning to their camp, to find it had been attacked, Björn reunites with Torvi and his brothers. After everyone is recovering, Björn tells Torvi that it was all Ragnar's fault. Björn helps Ragnar execute his plan to take the boats across the mountains.</p>

                <h2 id="Bjorn-transition">Bjorn's Transition</h2>
                <p>Bjorn rides out to face the invading Rus army on his own, barely staying on his white horse. The Rus are shocked and confused, having been told he was dead. Even Ivar looks spooked. Many believe him to be a ghost or to truly be a god. Ganbaatar says that Bjorn is not a ghost, and that he will prove it. He rides out towards Bjorn, and shoots three long arrows directly into Bjorn's chest. Somehow, Bjorn manages to not fall off his horse, but instead pulls out the arrows and uses the last of his strength to raise his sword, the Sword of Kings, one last time. At his signal, all the Vikings who have answered Bjorn's call for help come over the hills, surrounding the Rus. While he never reached the same level as his father, Bjorn's dying acting of turning into an arrow-ridden symbol ultimately saves his people.Bjorn is buried in a lavishly decorated tomb. He has been placed sitting on his horse for all eternity. In Gunnhild's eulogy, she names him the "King of all Norway" and the "Man Who Could Not Die."<br></p>

                <h4>Bjorn's Favorite Sayings</h4>
                <strong>The only way to tell if something is real is to sail there.<br>“When the spring comes, and my blood heats up, I want nothing more than to raid and fight.”</strong>
